# UltraEdit-website-clone
# I've crafted a web-based clone of the popular text editor, UltraEdit, leveraging the power of CSS Grid and Flexbox for a dynamic and responsive user interface. By employing these cutting-edge layout techniques, I've achieved a seamless experience across various screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile devices.

# Key Features:
# 1.Intuitive Interface: A familiar layout reminiscent of UltraEdit, optimized for modern web standards.
# 2.Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
# 3.CSS Grid and Flexbox: Utilizes these powerful layout systems for efficient and flexible design.
# 4.Core Text Editing Functionality: Essential features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and search/replace.

# This project showcases my proficiency in web development, particularly in CSS layout techniques. I'm excited to continue exploring the potential of CSS Grid and Flexbox to create innovative and user-friendly web applications.
